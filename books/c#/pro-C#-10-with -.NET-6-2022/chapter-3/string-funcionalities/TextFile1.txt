Strings are immutable, and when using methods, copies of the string are created in the heap. The string class can be inefficient and 
result in bloated code if misused, especially when performing string concatenation or working with huge 
amounts of text data. If you need to represent basic character data such as a US Social Security number, first 
or last names, or simple bits of text used within your application, the string class is the perfect choice.
