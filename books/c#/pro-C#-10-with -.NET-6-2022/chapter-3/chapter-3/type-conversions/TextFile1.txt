Thankfully, C# provides the checked keyword. When you wrap a statement (or a block of statements) 
within the scope of the checked keyword, the C# compiler emits additional CIL instructions that test for 
overflow conditions that may result when adding, multiplying, subtracting, or dividing two numerical 
data types.
