//Assume that the Shape class has defined a virtual method named Draw() that takes no parameters. Given 
//that every shape needs to render itself in a unique manner, subclasses such as Hexagon and Circle are free 
//to override this method to their own liking.

//Shape[] myShapes = new Shape[3];
//myShapes[0] = new Hexagon();
//myShapes[1] = new Circle();
//myShapes[2] = new Hexagon();
//foreach (Shape s in myShapes)
//{
//    // Use the polymorphic interface! 
//    s.Draw();
//}
